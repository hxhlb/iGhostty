#
# The contract is the one Scripts/package-deb.sh already established: xcodebuild
# produces *unsigned* products and the packager is the only thing that signs.
# That is why the iOS app target must never carry CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS — the
# device package and this one need different entitlements from the same build.
#
# What comes out is a single app bundle carrying its own helper:
#
#   iGhostVT.app/Contents/MacOS/iGhostVT                    Catalyst GUI
#   iGhostVT.app/Contents/MacOS/ighostvtd                   the launch agent, a proxy
#   iGhostVT.app/Contents/MacOS/ighostvtd-io                its child: the only forking process
#   iGhostVT.app/Contents/MacOS/ighostvtd-remote            its other child, while remote access is on
#   iGhostVT.app/Contents/MacOS/ighostvt-cli                the command-line client
#   iGhostVT.app/Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/wiki.qaq.ighostvtd.plist
#
# Neither Mach-O is sandboxed, and that is not a shortcut. Background Task
# Management on macOS 14.2 and later refuses to let a sandboxed app register an
# unsandboxed SMAppService job, and the helper cannot be sandboxed because it
# forkpty/execves the user's shell — every command would inherit the container.
# Hardened Runtime (--options runtime) is applied to both instead.
