/// Mach service listener.
///
/// Accepts several peers at once (an iPad can have more than one app
/// window). The daemon is demand-launched on both platforms: launchd starts
/// it at load and whenever a client looks the service up, and it leaves on
/// its own once nothing needs it — no peer for a while and no session held,
/// which `IOSupervisor` decides and carries out through the child's
/// `shutdown`. `KeepAlive = {SuccessfulExit = false}` restarts a crash and
/// lets that exit stand.
///
/// The exit cannot be made atomic against launchd routing a new connection,
/// so a client can arrive just as the child goes. The supervisor takes the
/// exit back when that happens — a fresh child, the proxy stays — and the
/// client, cut from the child that left, reconnects and replays the way it
/// does after any interruption. While remote access is on,
/// `ighostvtd-remote` holds a connection for as long as it runs, and the
/// daemon never sees itself idle.
///
/// This process holds no session: it is the jetsam-limited launchd job, and
/// everything with a buffer lives in the child (`IOSupervisor`).
